## Gnetum

A Minecraft mod that improves performance by distributing HUD updates over multiple frames.

### Overview

Gnetum divides a full HUD update into multiple "passes." Only one pass is rendered each frame, reducing the time taken on HUD updates and improving FPS.

It is the minimum FPS that decides how smooth the game feels. With this in mind Gnetum tries to evenly distribute HUD updates over multiple frames, meaning that it improves not only the average FPS, but also the minimum.

<summary>Technical explanations</summary>

The idea behind Gnetum is to reduce the framerate of the HUD, which is not cheap to render and does not really change often, to improve the overall performance of the game, in a way that improves both the average and the minimum FPS. To achieve this:

- Gnetum employs two framebuffers, called a back framebuffer and a front framebuffer, respectively
- Each frame will render a "pass", that is, a (customizable) portion of the complete HUD, to the back framebuffer
- If the number of passes is set to 4, for example, a full HUD update is distributed over 4 frames, saving a lot of draw calls every frame and improving FPS
- After all passes finish rendering, the back framebuffer is "swapped" with the front framebuffer
- Each frame also renders the front framebuffer, which contains a texture of the full HUD

An additional HUD FPS limiter is implemented, mainly to save power on scenarios where the game framerate is very high.

### Configuration

A configuration screen is available for advanced players and modpack makers to fine-tune Gnetum for optimal performance, accessible via keybind (bound to ```End``` by default).

- You can configure whether to cache each element, and if so, in which pass they are rendered.
- You can set the number of passes. A higher number means the HUD is updated less often, improving FPS.
- You can set a limit for the FPS of the HUD.
- A performance analyzer is implemented to help you monitor the rendering time of each pass.

### Compatibility

#### 1.20.1 & 1.21.1

✔️ ImmediatelyFast: fully compatible and recommended.

#### 1.12.2

⚠️ OptiFine: make sure "Fast Render" is disabled (this mod would do nothing otherwise.)

⚠️ StellarCore: make sure their HUD Caching feature is disabled (if you are unsure how to disable it you can ignore this: it's disabled by default.)
